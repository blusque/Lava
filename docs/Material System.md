## Material System

- ### Main Purpose: To make objects in different colors

*Material* shaders are programs to take color input and render them. and they render things with some configurations.

In GLSL, the data is called *uniform*. So the ***Material* is a shader program and a bunch of *uniform* variants**.

* ### !! Balance the flexibility and performance

Instead of using a lot of *if* and *else* in one shader program, youâ€™d better use more *Materials*.
